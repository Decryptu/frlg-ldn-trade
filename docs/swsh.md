# Sword and Shield

The second **native** Switch title this project has read, and the first one whose Mystery Gift
menu has a local-wireless branch - the same shape of target as FireRed's Wonder Card, one
generation of hardware later.

Measured on a **Shield 1.3.2 EUR cartridge image** (`01008db008c2c000`, update NCA, SDK 7.7.0.0),
against a **French Sword 1.3.2** on the console. The two builds share their network code; where a
finding could differ between the pair it says so.

## What is under the game

Sword/Shield statically links the whole of Pia into `main` - 252 `nn::pia` classes and 2036 virtual
methods come straight out of the binary's own RTTI - and imports `nn::ldn` from nnSdk. So the stack
is the one this project already speaks: LDN underneath, Pia above it, and the game's own layer on
top of that.

Above Pia the game is **protocol buffers**, not hand-rolled structs: `main` carries the
`FileDescriptorProto` for every P2P message set it uses (`gflnet.p2p.framework.pb`,
`gflnet.p2p.block.pb`, `gflnet.p2p.sync.pb`, and one package per content - trade, battle, camp,
raid). A game that ships its own schema is a game whose messages do not have to be guessed.

## The LDN passphrase

    W3GoSMEn7RIIUQ89rzqBHGhGferRNb7K18ZBq2aNuj8Us9RO9Q9JYyGOZlLy8MYL

**64 bytes, used raw.** FACT, read out of the binary rather than a wiki: the game calls Pia's
`nn::pia::local::LdnCreateSessionSetting` passphrase setter with a literal length of `0x40` and a
rodata pointer, and the buffer at that pointer is the string above:

    0x006c3eb4  adrp x1, #0x203f000        ; the 64-byte literal
    0x006c3eb8  add  x1, x1, #0xf04
    0x006c3ec0  add  x0, sp, #0x10         ; the LdnCreateSessionSetting
    0x006c3ec4  mov  w2, #0x40             ; 64, not a NUL-terminated length
    0x006c3ec8  bl   #0x1790450

The binary holds **two identical copies** of it (`0x203ff04` and `0x203ff45`), which is what a
create path and a join path each carrying their own literal looks like.

It is **not** on the NintendoClients wiki's [LDN passphrases] page, which has no Sword/Shield row at
all. It is byte-for-byte the string that page gives for **Scarlet/Violet**, and differs from
**Legends: Arceus** in one character - `HGhG` here, `HGHG` there. A row that looks like a
transcription error in someone else's table is two real values.

## The Pia game key

    p1frXqxmeCZWFv0X

The wiki's Pokemon Sword/Shield row, and now **verified in the binary**: the literal is at
`0x01c3dc87`, referenced from three call sites, and the one at `0x006ca91c` shows how it is used -
sixteen ASCII bytes loaded with a single `ldp` into a `{u32 enabled = 1; u8 key[16]}` beside the
session setting, handed to Pia's session entry at `0x0183fd10`:

    0x006ca914  mov  w8, #1 ; str w8, [sp, #0x18]     crypto enabled
    0x006ca91c  adrp x8, #0x1c3d000 ; add x8, x8, #0xc87
    0x006ca924  ldp  x9, x8, [x8]                     the 16 bytes, raw ASCII
    0x006ca938  stur x9, [sp, #0x1c]                  -> the setting's key field
    0x006ca93c  bl   #0x183fd10                       create/join, with the setting

Unlike BDSP's, this one needed no metadata archaeology: a native title keeps its constants in
rodata where a cross-reference finds them.

## Where the passphrase goes

Pia's own LDN wrapper holds it. `nn::pia::local::LdnCreateNetworkJob`'s object keeps the passphrase
at **+0xC4** and its length at **+0x104**, and the job builds the `nn::ldn::SecurityConfig` from
them immediately before calling `nn::ldn::CreateNetwork`:

    0x01797280  add  x1, x19, #0xc4        ; the passphrase
    0x01797284  ldrb w2, [x19, #0x104]     ; its length
    0x01797284  bl   memcpy                ; -> SecurityConfig +4
    0x017972bc  bl   nn::ldn::CreateNetwork

The same object holds the `NetworkConfig`'s intent at **+0xB8** (the local communication id, a u64)
and **+0xC0**. `nn::pia::local::LdnBackgroundProcessJob` validates the length as **16..64** before
any of this runs, which is the same range `docs/ldn.md` records.

## Pia here is version 4, and we have never spoken it

`docs/pia.md` had two bands, 6.32+ (version byte 15/16) and 5.27-5.45 (version byte 9). Sword and
Shield are **neither**: their header carries **4**, and the header is a different shape.

    0x00  4  magic 0x32AB9864, big-endian
    0x04  1  0x80 (encrypted) | version (0x7F) = 4
    0x05  1  a station index
    0x06  2  big-endian halfword
    0x08  8  AES-GCM nonce
    0x10  16 AES-GCM tag, NOT truncated to 8 the way 5.27-5.45 truncates it
    0x20     ciphertext

Read out of the game's own deserializer (`0x01774730`, which requires more than 0x1f bytes and then
copies field by field), its initializer (`0x017748bc`, one 64-bit store of `0x00000004_32AB9864`)
and three validators that each check `(byte & 0x7f) == 4`. **BDSP's binary has the identical three
validators against 9**, which is what makes this a comparison rather than a guess - see
`docs/pia.md` "The version-4 header".

So neither `pia_connect.py` nor `pia5.py` applies as it stands, and a third module is what talking
to this console will need. The session-key derivation is a separate question: `nn::pia::local` and
`nn::pia::lan` are both present and named here, so the same class-name test that settled it for BDSP
settles it here.

## Mystery Gift has a local branch

FACT, from the game's own state names. The receive-method chooser is
`StateSelectReceiveDataBase` and it has five siblings, one per menu button
(`L_mystery_top_btn_00` .. `_04`):

| state | what it is |
|---|---|
| `StateSelectReceiveDataInternet` | over the network |
| `StateSelectReceiveDataSerial` | a serial code / password |
| **`StateSelectReceiveDataLocal`** | **local wireless** |
| `StateSelectReceiveDataFromBall` | the Poke Ball Plus |
| `StateSelectReceiveDataRankMatch` | ranked-battle rewards |

and the receive states themselves are `StateReceiveBase`, `StateReceiveInternet`,
`StateReceiveSerial`, **`StateReceiveLocal`** (`0x01004938`), `StateReceiveFromBall`,
`StateReceiveRankMatch`, plus `StateReceiveNews` and `StateReceiveComplete`.

The game also counts what it received by channel: the play-record keys are `fushigi_net`,
`fushigi_serial` and **`fushigi_p2p`**, sitting beside `yy_battle_single_p2p` / `_net` in the same
table. A record key per channel is a channel the game expects to use.

**There is a static call path from `StateReceiveLocal`'s block into the LDN session setup.**
`0x01004e54` (inside the block) calls `0x010b7100`, which calls `0x010f6b00`, which reaches the same
class the passphrase call site belongs to. Every edge of that chain was checked instruction by
instruction rather than taken from the search that suggested it.

DEDUCTION, and it is not yet proof: an indirect call is invisible to a static walk, so a path found
this way is evidence the branch is wired up, not evidence of what it says. The cheap way to settle
it is the air - open the Mystery Gift local screen on the console and see whether `ldn_scan.py`
finds a network or the console is scanning for ours.

## Reading the cartridge

The XCI is 13.3 GB on a network share and **nothing is unpacked**. `tools/switch/xci_read.py` walks
the HFS0 partitions, decrypts each NCA header in place (AES-128-XTS under `header_key`, big-endian
sector tweak) and prints the title id, content type, key generation, each section's offset, its
counter and its section key:

    ./.venv/bin/python tools/switch/xci_read.py <the.xci> --keys prod.keys --type Program

A cartridge NCA's rights id is all zeroes, so there is no ticket step at all: the body key is key
area slot 2 under `key_area_key_application_<generation>`, where the generation is
`max(crypto_type, crypto_type2) - 1`. The 1.3.2 update's exefs is section 0 of the update Program
NCA, an ordinary CTR PartitionFS - the BKTR patching only touches its RomFS - so `main` comes out
with one more flag:

    ./.venv/bin/python tools/switch/xci_read.py <the.xci> --nca 87e41bc8 --exefs 0 --extract main

Then `nso_read.py` decompresses it (text 0..0x1900fc0, rodata to 0x24da168) and `rtti_names.py`
names the middleware:

    ./.venv/bin/python tools/switch/rtti_names.py main.bin 0x1900fc0 --rodata 0x1901000:0x24da168

`tools/switch/nso_imports.py` is what makes an `nn::ldn` call findable: a call into nnSdk goes
through a GOT slot filled by a JUMP_SLOT relocation naming the symbol, so the slot is the thing to
cross-reference, and its one PLT stub is the thing to count callers of.

## Taking a seat

`bin/swsh_join.py` scans, reports and associates. It carries the passphrase above and nothing else
game-specific, because nothing else is settled: the local communication id is filled at runtime, so
the first run is a scan that writes every advertisement it sees to `scratchpad/swsh_net_facts.json`
and names the ones this project already knows.

    sudo -E ./.venv/bin/python bin/swsh_join.py --scan-only

`--pw-mode` defaults to `raw` rather than to BDSP's sweep of readings, because the length here is an
instruction (`mov w2, #0x40`) rather than the length of a wiki string. If raw fails, the reading is
what to doubt last.

Above LDN there is nothing to run: version 4 has no transport in this repository. `pokeldn.swsh`
holds the constants and the one derivation that IS shared with BDSP - the LDN session key, whose
copy at `0x017ab010` is instruction-for-instruction `pokeldn.ldn.pia5.ldn_session_key`: seed an
xorshift128 with the recurrence around `0x6C078965`, take four draws into consecutive words, and
AES-128-ECB them under the game key that Pia keeps at `LocalProtocol+0x4d4` (its setter is at
`0x017ab750`, and what it copies is exactly the `{u32 enabled; u8 key[16]}` the game built).

That settles which of the two families applies. `nn::pia::local` and `nn::pia::lan` are both present
and named in this binary, and it is the **local** one - the LDN row of `docs/pia.md`'s table - that
holds this code.

## Open questions

- **The two unnamed header fields**, the byte at 0x05 and the halfword at 0x06. What writes them is
  `0x017beb74`/`0x017beb78`; what they mean is a deduction until a capture agrees.
- **What seeds the session key.** The derivation is settled; its input is not. `0x0179bff0` ->
  `0x01774f40` caches a value computed from `LocalProtocol+0x80`, and whether that is the
  advertisement's session parameter the way BDSP's is has not been read.
- **The local communication id and version.** Held at the Pia object's +0xB8 and +0xC0, filled at
  runtime from an object in `.bss` rather than a literal. Reachable from a scan of the console's own
  advertisement without reading any more code.
- **What `StateReceiveLocal` actually sends**, past the fact that it reaches the session setup.
- **Sword against Shield.** Everything above is read off Shield. The passphrase, the game key, the
  Pia version and the Mystery Gift states are game code, not per-version data, so they should be
  identical; association against the console is what proves it.
